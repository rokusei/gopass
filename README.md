# gopass
A simple Password Manager written in Go

## Design

This design is similar to other existing password managers, but it tries to simplify it as much as possible to make auditing it as simple as possible.

Given a Master Password, then the gopass will generate the following:
- Master Password Salt, a 4-6 randomly generated "fakelish" word salt, each word is 3 to 8 characters. A salt will range from 12 to 48 characters.
- Encryption Key Hash, Generated by using the MP and MP Salt, 101,101 PBKDF2 iterations, SHA-512 HMAC, and a key length of 32 (for AES256)
- Authentication Hash, Generated by using Encryption Key Hash and MP Salt, 1 PBKDF2 interation, SHA-512 HMAC, and a key length of 64 (for authentication)

Given an Encryption Key Hash, the Encrypt function will encrypt a byte array with AES256 and a 16bit random IV (prepended).
The Decrypt function will decrypt using the prepended IV, and provided encryption key hash.
